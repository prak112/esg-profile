# Motivation üöÄ
_Blog posts which motivated me to compose the project are:_
* **[Databricks, Engineering blog/tutorial post by Antoine Amend](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/07/10/a-data-driven-approach-to-environmental-social-and-governance.html)**
* **[Sustainometric blog post, ESG to SDGs](https://sustainometric.com/esg-to-sdgs-connected-paths-to-a-sustainable-future/)**


## Background
Sustainability standards refers to the ESG guidelines outlined by GRI. Organisations report their non-financial impacts according to the [GRI framework](https://www.globalreporting.org/how-to-use-the-gri-standards/gri-standards-english-language/) They could be briefed as follows:
* Environmental - **E** 
    * building economic growth within environmental degradation limits, i.e., keeping water, soil, air & biodiversity (wildlife) clean
* Social        - **S**
    * focusing on maintenance and prosperity of the employees and their communities, 
* Governance    - **G**
    * developing ethical standards of administration within the organisation
 

# Aim of the Study
**To determine if there exists a correlation betweeen sustainability reporting according to GRI (ESG Reporting framework) and long-term growth of Organisation.**


# _**Hypothesis**_ üè∑Ô∏è
### **Traditional Growth Model (H0)**
_Value creation & ESG Reporting by Organisations do NOT CORRELATE with GRI standards and sometimes stagnates performance_</br>

### **Modern Growth Model (HA)**
_Value creation & ESG Reporting by Organisations do CORRELATE with GRI standards and leads to resilient performance_</br>


# _Assumption_
1. _Organisation's stock performance defines the economic growth of that entity_
2. _Sustainability reports are based on GRI standard framework and are updated_

# **DECLARATION** 
- I understand that there could be several possibilities to show the growth of an Organisation. 
- This is my attempt to focus on one aspect of growth identifiers. 
- Hence, showing the **correlation between following a global ESG standard framework (GRI) and Long-term value creation**.


# Approach üèóÔ∏è
## Sustainability profiling of Companies
* **MODULE 1** - Collect list of top 100 companies globally from [dataset](https://github.com/prak112/esg-profile/blob/7b320c46d47dca93c9b0abf453bcc234039b91c7/dataset) üíæ
* **MODULE 2** - Collect Annual Sustainability reports of these companies
* **MODULE 3** - Process the reports to identify Key Sustainability Indicators (KSIs)
* **MODULE 4** - Categorize KSIs into industrially acknowledged impacts:
    - EnvironmentaL -  impact on land, air, water and ecosystems
    - Social        - impact on employee and their familys' lifestyles
    - Governance    - impact of company policies governing the management of above two impacts

* **MODULE 5** - Visualize Stock Market performance based on their KSIs 

* **MODULE 6** - _IF & Wherever possible_, Identify :
  - **Proxy data** provided by services to companies
  - **Outsourcing ESG activities**, such as purchasing carbon offsets without improvements in Company's Sustainability
