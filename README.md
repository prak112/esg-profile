# Motivation üöÄ
_Blog posts which motivated me to compose the project are:_
* **[Databricks, Engineering blog/tutorial post by Antoine Amend](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/07/10/a-data-driven-approach-to-environmental-social-and-governance.html)**
* **[Sustainometric blog post, ESG to SDGs](https://sustainometric.com/esg-to-sdgs-connected-paths-to-a-sustainable-future/)**

## _Abbreviations_ üî§
- **ESG** -- [Environmental, Social and Governance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp)
- **SDG** -- [Sustainable Developmental Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)

# Aim of the Study
To determine if there exists a correlation betweeen the ESG initiatives and growth & development of a company over the long-term.


# _**Hypothesis**_ üè∑Ô∏è
### **Traditional Growth Model (H0)**
_**Value creation & ESG initiatives followed by Companies/Organisations does NOT CORRELATE with their sustainability standards and sometimes stagnates performance**_</br>

### **Modern Growth Model (HA)**
_**Value creation & ESG initiatives followed by Companies/Organisations does CORRELATE with their sustainability standards and leads to resilient performance**_</br>

Sustainability standards refer to ESG initiatives being followed upon and accounted by the organisation itself or by a third-party. They can be defined in brief layman-terms as follows-
- building their economic growth within the permissible environmental limits, i.e., water, soil, air & biodiversity(wildlife) 
- focusing on prosperity of the employees and their communities & maintaining, and 
- developing ethical standards of administration within the organisation

# _Assumption_
1. _Organisation's stock performance defines the economic growth of that entity_
2. _Sustainability reports based on ESG initiatives of the respective Organisations are updated_

# **DECLARATION** 
I understand that there could be several possibilities to show the growth of an Organisation. This is my attempt to focus on one aspect of growth identifiers and show the correlation between ESG initiatives and Long-term value creation by the Organisation could lead to its own prosperity.


# Approach üèóÔ∏è
## Sustainability profiling of Companies
* **MODULE 1** - Collect list of top 100 companies globally from [_dataset_](https://github.com/prak112/esg-profile/blob/7b320c46d47dca93c9b0abf453bcc234039b91c7/dataset) üíæ
* **MODULE 2**- Collect Annual Sustainability reports of these companies
* **MODULE 3** - Process the reports to identify Key Sustainability Indicators (KSIs)
* **MODULE 4** - Categorize KSIs into industrially acknowledged impacts:
    - EnvironmentaL -  impact on land, air, water and ecosystems
    - Social        - impact on employee and their familys' lifestyles
    - Governance    - impact of company policies governing the management of above two impacts

* **MODULE 5** - Visualize Stock Market performance based on their KSIs 

* **MODULE 6** - _IF & Wherever possible_, Identify :
  - **Proxy data** provided by services to companies
  - **Outsourcing ESG activities**, such as purchasing carbon offsets without improvements in Company's Sustainability
